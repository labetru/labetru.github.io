Poolside convo about your summer last night<br>
Ooh yeah, about your summer last night<br>
Ain't give you no play, mm<b>
Could I make you shive last night?<br>
Could I make you shy on the last night? (Last night)<br>
Could we make it in? Do we have time?<br></b></font></p>

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight<br>
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white<br>
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life<br>
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice<br>
And our time was right<br></u></font></p>

Keep a place for me, for me<br>
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing<br>
It's nothing, it's nothing<br>
Keep a place for me, for me<br></i></font></p>

Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry<br>
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes<br>
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO<br>
That's like never<br>
'Cause I made you use your self-control<br>
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control<br></u></font></p>

I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave<br>
Take down some summertime<br>
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night<br>
